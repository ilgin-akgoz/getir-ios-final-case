### Product Listing
On the Product Listing screen, the user can scroll through the horizontal and vertical lists of products that are developed with UICollectionView's compositional layout component. Adding or subtracting the count of the product is possible by using the stepper button, and the total price is reflected in the cart button on the top right corner. By clicking the right bar button, the user navigates to the Shopping Cart screen if the cart is not empty.

### Product Detail
By clicking a product, the user is directed to the Product Detail screen. The product's name, price, and attributes can be seen on this screen as well. The user may add that specific product to the cart by using the button, and the total price is updated and displayed on the right bar button as well. If the shopping cart is not empty, the user may go to the Shopping Cart screen by clicking the right bar button.

### Shopping Cart
This screen contains a table view of products that are added to the cart. The user may delete all products currently in the cart by clicking the trash button on the top right, or can place the order by clicking the button on the tab bar. Changing the product counts is possible with the stepper button. If the place order button is clicked, an alert is shown to the user. After confirming this alert, the cart is emptied and the user is navigated back to the Product Listing screen.
